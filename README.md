# Individual Differences in Visual Object Recognition

## Data Science Insititute Summer Research Program 2020

### Summary of Research
Previous research has shown that people vary in visual object recognition abilities. We have a large-scale dataset to attest to this. The principle question that my project addresses is how this variability works, specifically focusing on how the brain represents visual objects. In other words, why do neural representations of the same object differ from person to person?

We can replicate these representations with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), models inspired by primate vision. Recently, CNNs have enabled image recognition in consumer-grade electronics, matching and often exceeding human performance. My project examines why people differ in visual object recognition abilities by modeling the representation stage using CNNs. With computational models, we can test theories of vision with unprecedented control, complementing data from human participants. By leveraging analytical techniques from the neuroscience and computer science literatures, This projectâ€™s implications include insights into high-risk vision tasks (e.g. radiology) and the development of machines that emulate humans instead of merely outperforming them.
