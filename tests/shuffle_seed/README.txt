Run on workstation

Run 3 instances, same seed, same hash, shuffle = True. Also run 1 instnace with different seed, also run 1 instance with shuffle false and 1 with different hash.

Hypothesis: Setting the hash should ensure the shuffle is the same every instance. Different seed/hash/shuffle should cause the only differences and they should be mutually different as well.
